    - Excluded Rolling Stock (Trains, Wagons etc.) Prototypes from landfill.

Version: 1.1.0
Date: 16.01.2021
  Changes:
    - Updated for Factorio version 1.1
    - You can no longer add landfill tiles to the blueprint in hand if the blueprint comes from the blueprint library.
      This is due to (mainly good) changes in the base game regarding the library and will require a bigger rewrite if at all possible.
  Info:
    - I am back! Many apologies for lack of updates, mainly caused by some personal issues.
      Many thanks to schmorp and T-A-R that cared enough about the mod to try and revive it!
  Bug fixes:
    - Tile calculations modified by schmorp to work better in edge cases and with rail entities.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.17.3
Date: 31.03.2019
  Changes:
    - Attempts to add landfill tiles where the original blueprint had path tiles (brick, concrete...).
    - Also now preserves existing landfill.
    - Use Shift-click on the button for the old behaviour, only adding landfill under entities even if there are other tiles present.
    - Control-click attempts to re-add the existing tiles, only mildly useful and only together with shift.
    - Support added for the mod Platforms which adds a special type of removable landfill.
    - Setting added for choosing between original landfill and Platforms
    - Re-written button code, please report odd behaviour when migrating existing saves!

  Bug fixes:
    - Fixed crash when there was no entities at all in the blueprint
